# AVT

Trains to predict the price change over the next few timesteps.
It can move volumes 10x up to 100x its actual capital commitment at roughly breakeven/ commission costs.

It's currently missing a maintenance mechanism, so if you train it and let it trade for a while after a day or two 
it starts performing worse..
